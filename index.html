      <p>eToy Remix, NOTFLIX: </p>  <a href="http://www.nuutflix.com/">Notflix</a>   <a href= "https://twitter.com/notflix">Twitter</a> <a href= "http://www.etoy.com/">eToy</a>
      <p>Notflix is a remix of the Eurpoen digital art group Etoy's website in which they "borrowed" a Swiss toy companies name, and even sold their company stock, pushing and experimenting with the bondaries of art. Etoy was formed in 1994 and mainly used the name for performance at raves and techno music events. We decided to use Netflix as a target as it is a much more popular group, and have taken a stand and adoption of Google DRM. </p>

      <p>After seeing countless artworks on both the S Edition and SPAMM websites I came across the artist LoVid. I have always been a fan of lo-fi 70s-90s digital work and their particular style really resonated with me. The piece I liked in particular was Pink Pop Gulp in which a multicolored animated pattern is mirrored and warped as it moves across the screen. I was created by analog synthesizers and digital composition techniques. Across the pattern floats a transparent, crisp object that clashes with the blurry nature of the background. This contrast allows the viewer to see that this piece was made recently using digital techniques as it would not have been possible to have such a high resolution object without post-2000 digital processing.</p>

    <p>There were a few other pieces that I really liked as well including Weird Ass Shark and Night Shade Time Glades. Weird Ass Shark was actually the first piece of theirs that I found. LoVid is a New York based duo including Tali Hinkis and Kyle Lapidus. They formed in 2001 and work with analog synthesizers, immersive installations, single channel videos, textiles, participatory projects, mobile media, cinema, and audiovisual performances. Much of their work follows the aesthetic seen in the pieces I am showing now.

<p>In my Art History Class we have been looking at the work of Woody and Steina Vazulka, who also work with both analog and digital, combining the two into beautiful works of art. Analog synthesizers have a very unique unreplicatable flavour that I think too many artists forget about or file under outdated. It warms my heart to see artists still using them so many decades after their evolution to digital, while still using some advantages of digital. The Vazulka’s refer to video the video image as “clay” which I think was very ahead of their time given that 3d modelling today is often compared to sculpting, even more so with VR modelling.</p>

<p>Another artist we looked at in class was Nam June Paik, a pioneer in the digital art field. He experimented with magnets which is why LoVid’s piece Wierd Ass Shark made me think of him. He would place magnets in front of televisions and manipulate the signal in a much more freehand way than the analog synthesizers LoVid uses. That’s not to say Nam never used these synths, he just liked to experiment with the signal even more directly.

<p>The final reason I believe I fell in love with Lovid’s piece Pink Pop Gulp is due to its similarity to Revenge Television’s Logo, a video production company assosiated with one of my favorite artists Skepta. I have seen the logo many a time and maybe this is why I felt so at home looking at Pink Pop Gulp.</p>

<p>rardAR is a hide and seek style AR game that takes place in finitie locations around the city, in this case the EV building at concordia. One would be able to see which buildings and locations had games going on from home and then would travel to that location to play. They would also get a prompt when entering the building letting them know how many people are playing, and what game mode they would like to select. Although the mainstream AR is not yet available I think a game like this could be a reality soon and would change the way one travels a city or even small building.</p>
